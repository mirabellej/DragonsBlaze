# DragonsBlaze
Unity 3D rails-style shooter. 
</br></br>
Dragon's Blaze is a first person rails-style shooter where you're a dragon helping a teenage witch (yet to come on the scene) whose home is under siege by trolls. Your magical fiery breath has the power to transport the trolls to another realm (if only we all had such a power!)
